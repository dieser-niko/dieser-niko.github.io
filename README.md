or dieserniko on most places online. 

I'm currently in an apprenticeship as a software developer since late 2020.

My programming language skills are limited to python only, but sooner or later I'll probably start with JavaScript as my second language.

## Projects
Currently I don't have that much open-source projects, since I'm not really used to create a repository for my projects.
Most of my projects are privately stored in a cloud.
