or dieserniko on most places online. 

I'm currently in an apprenticeship as a software developer since late 2020.

My programming language skills are limited to python only, but sooner or later I'll probably start with JavaScript as my second language.

## Projects

### [SpotipyAnon](https://github.com/dieser-niko/spotipy-anon) | Status: finished and released

An extension to Spotipy for anonymous access to the Spotify Web API.
Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spotipy-anon/)

It allows to use the Spotify API with the help of [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy).
Not all endpoints are accessible, those include user specific endpoints for example.

### [Pi-Bar](https://github.com/dieser-niko/pi-bar) | Status: half-through, GUI and main script missing

A Raspberry Pi as a bartender. Select your favourite drink on a touchpad.

Currently all the smaller functions are working as intended, now it has to be bundled in a main function.

---

### [StorageExplorer](https://github.com/dieser-niko/StorageExplorer) | Status: finished

Shows the storage of files and even folders.

---

### Radiopy | Status: Early version, not public

A script that collects music from radio stations and converts them into spotify playlists.
The test version of the script is already working and is being executed every 24 hours.
Check it out: [autoplaylist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31bk3o6pc4ehozimdakaglavex2e)

### Note:
Currently I don't have that much open-source projects, since I'm not really used to create a repository for my projects.
Most of my projects are privately stored in a cloud.
