or dieserniko on most places online. 

I'm currently in an apprenticeship as a software developer since late 2020.

My programming language skills are limited to python only, but sooner or later I'll probably start with JavaScript as my second language.

## Projects

### [Radiopy](https://github.com/radiopy) | Status: Early version, not public (yet)

A script that collects music from radio stations and converts them into spotify playlists.
I'm planning to create more than one repository, so I've created an organisation.
The test version of the script is already working and is being executed every 24 hours.
Check it out: [radiopy on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31bk3o6pc4ehozimdakaglavex2e)

### [SpotipyAnon](https://github.com/dieser-niko/spotipy-anon) | Status: finished and released

An extension to Spotipy for anonymous access to the Spotify Web API.
Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spotipy-anon/)

It allows to use the Spotify API with the help of [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy).
Not all endpoints are accessible, those include user specific endpoints for example.

### [Pi-Bar](https://github.com/dieser-niko/pi-bar) | Status: early midlife crisis, redo everything

As configuring the drinks was already more complicated than it needed to be, I decided to start again.
The plan is to let the owner configure the drinks via the web interface, as the file and folder structure is not very clear.
This approach can provide the owner with an experience similar to that of the user.

### [StorageExplorer](https://github.com/dieser-niko/StorageExplorer) | Status: finished

Shows the storage of files and even folders.

### Note:
Currently I don't have that much open-source projects, since I'm not really used to create a repository for my projects.
Most of my projects are privately stored in a cloud.
