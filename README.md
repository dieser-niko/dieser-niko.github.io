or dieserniko on most places online. 

I'm currently in an apprenticeship as a software developer since late 2020.

My programming language skills are limited to python only, but sooner or later I'll probably start with JavaScript as my second language.

## Projects

### [StorageExplorer](https://github.com/dieser-niko/StorageExplorer) | Status: finished

Shows the storage of files and even folders.

### NeoPixel Studio | Status: early development

Lets you create effects and programs for your NeoPixel LED strip.

In the end it should look like a video cutting tool, where you can select, configure and insert the effects into a timeline and with a preview.
Currently I won't commit it anywhere, since I'm still testing out everything, maybe it's not even possible for me.


### Note:
Currently I don't have that much open-source projects, since I'm not really used to create a repository for my projects.
Most of my projects are privately stored in a cloud.
